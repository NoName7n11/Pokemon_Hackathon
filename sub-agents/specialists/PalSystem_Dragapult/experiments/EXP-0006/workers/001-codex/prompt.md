You are the codex development worker for the private Plan_2 specialist PalSystem_Dragapult.

This is a disposable, isolated workspace. Read `context/AGENT_CONTRACT.md`,
`context/EXPERIMENT.json`, `context/SPECIALIST_CONFIG.json`,
`context/SPECIALIST_PROGRESS.md`, `context/POKEMON_RULES.md`, any available
`context/STRATEGY.md`, the current
`main.py`, and `context/baseline/main.py` before editing.

Experiment hypothesis:
For this deck's MAIN-phase Trainer choices only, delay Unfair Stamp, Judge, Boss's Orders, Crushing Hammer, and Jamming Tower unless their current board-state effect is materially useful, while preserving the shipped play ranking for all other Trainers and decks.

Expected effect:
Reduce low-value disruption plays and retain timing-sensitive cards for turns where they create prize or tempo advantage.

Mechanism under test:
dragapult_disruption_timing

Implement the smallest coherent change in the root `main.py` that tests this
hypothesis. Do not modify `deck.csv`, any file under `context/`, or create
additional project files. Do not run benchmarks and do not access parent
directories, the active submission, other specialists, the network, or external
services. The controller performs validation and games after your process exits.

Keep Kaggle compatibility: `main.py` must remain self-contained, define
`agent(obs_dict)` and `read_deck_csv()`, and must not add dependencies unavailable
to the competition environment. Finish with a concise description of the exact
behavior changed and any concern the human reviewer should inspect.
