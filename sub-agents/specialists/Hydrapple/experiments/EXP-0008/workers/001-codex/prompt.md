You are the codex development worker for the private Plan_2 specialist Hydrapple.

This is a disposable, isolated workspace. Read `context/AGENT_CONTRACT.md`,
`context/EXPERIMENT.json`, `context/SPECIALIST_CONFIG.json`,
`context/SPECIALIST_PROGRESS.md`, `context/POKEMON_RULES.md`, the current
`main.py`, and `context/baseline/main.py` before editing.

Experiment hypothesis:
When a normal Energy attachment makes an attack usable this turn, apply readiness preference only to the Active Pokemon and preserve the shipped ranking for every Benched target.

Expected effect:
Reduce wasted Active attachments without recreating harmful bench-first Energy routing.

Mechanism under test:
active_only_attack_readiness_attachment

Implement the smallest coherent change in the root `main.py` that tests this
hypothesis. Do not modify `deck.csv`, any file under `context/`, or create
additional project files. Do not run benchmarks and do not access parent
directories, the active submission, other specialists, the network, or external
services. The controller performs validation and games after your process exits.

Keep Kaggle compatibility: `main.py` must remain self-contained, define
`agent(obs_dict)` and `read_deck_csv()`, and must not add dependencies unavailable
to the competition environment. Finish with a concise description of the exact
behavior changed and any concern the human reviewer should inspect.
